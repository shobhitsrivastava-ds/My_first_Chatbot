# My_first_Chatbot

## What are chatbots?
A chatbot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, although as of 2019, they are far short of being able to pass the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler ones scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.

## 1.Motivaton:
I got the motivation about making this chatboot during the time I was learning Natural Langage Processing, using NLTK for simple lammetizing purpose didn't moved me much, so I got an idea for making chatbot with the time api like NLTK. So here it is.

## 2.Pre-requisities:
For running and using this project you will have the following libraries requirement.
### NLTK
                                      $ pip install nltk
                                      
### String
                                      $ pip install String
                                      
### Numpy
                                      $ pip install numpy
                                      
### Random
                                      $ pip install random
                                      
that's it.
## 3. How to run: 
It is very easy to run this code.You just have to save the text from the domain where you wanna use the chatbot in the chatbot.txt file, and then get on to open the .ipynb file in Jupyter notebook, and run the block of code one by one, then you are good to go.
